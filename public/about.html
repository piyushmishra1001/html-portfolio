<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> I am currently a law student, but I've always been passionate about technology and coding.<br> Over the last few years, I've been developing my skills in web development, specifically HTML, through various personal projects.</p>
<p>One of my most recent projects involved creating a movie ranking web page using HTML.<br> I researched the top 5 movies based on certain criteria and presented the data in a visually appealing manner.<br> This project helped me develop my skills in HTML and also taught me how to present data in a creative way.</p>
<p>Another project I worked on was a simple birthday invite web application.<br> I designed and developed the application using HTML and some other web technologies. <br>This project helped me develop my problem-solving skills and taught me how to apply my HTML skills to create a practical solution.</p>
<p>I am excited about the opportunity to work as a web developer because it combines my passion for technology and coding with my desire to constantly learn and develop new skills. <br>I am confident that my experience in both law and web development has prepared me well for this role</p>
