<h1>The Best Movies According to Piyush</h1>
<h2>The Top Three Movies are</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. You Can Live Forever</h3>
<p>After her father dies, teenager Jaime (Anwen O’Driscoll) is sent to the scenic Canadian seaside, where she’s to live
    with her aunt (Liane Balaban) and uncle (Antoine Yared) in a tight-knit Jehovah’s Witness community. As a
    non-believer and a lesbian, Jaime feels isolated in more ways than one, even before her relatives pressure her into
    attending religious services.

    But it’s there, at a church meeting, that Jaime meets Marike (June Laporte), the minister’s daughter, whose bright
    smile and carefree demeanor put her at ease and stir up other, more complicated emotions. Soon, the two are at
    Marike’s house for dinner, then sleeping in her bed. Before long, they’re inseparable. But even as Jaime and Marike
    study the Bible and go door-to-door with brochures, their mutual attraction grows until it’s undeniable.</p>
<h3>2. Unrest</h3>
<p> Cyril Schäublin’s “Unrest” is set in another time made for our time. With the present-day resurgence of interest in
    unions, collective action, and mutual aid, a look back at the then-emerging school of thought that put the
    well-being of workers and everyday people over the wills of factory owners and corrupt officials feels right on
    time. Unfortunately, like a watch with ill-fitting parts, not all of the film’s creative choices work together
    seamlessly. “Unrest” is an intriguing period piece but a flawed curio that never quite achieves its soul-stirring
    goals. </p>
<h3>3. White House Plumbers</h3>
<p> “White House Plumbers” is the story of a couple of tried-and-true Americans who wanted to serve their president.
    That description can go any which way, and it certainly fits the bizarre legacy of seasoned agent G. Gordon Liddy
    and his associate, Howard Hunt, who led the disastrous espionage operations later known as the Watergate scandal. As
    this goofy but mild miniseries from co-creators Alex Gregory and Peter Huyck presents it, the two were hotshots who
    would essentially bicker over who was the biggest patriot. They engrained their loyalty to the country and President
    Nixon into shady and clumsy work, and their superiors, like Attorney General John Mitchell and Attorney John Dean,
    supported them. Before Watergate, Liddy and Hunt had become known for getting the job done, though not necessarily
    in a flattering way for the term "American intelligence." </p>
